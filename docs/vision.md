# CalmOS — Product Vision

## 1. What Problem CalmOS Solves
People track habits, tasks, and wellness separately.
They don’t know:
- When they work best
- Why some days feel productive and others don’t

CalmOS exists to close this gap.

## 2. What CalmOS Is
CalmOS is a personal operating system that:
- Learns from daily wellness and focus data
- Predicts daily Flow
- Suggests small adjustments to improve calm and productivity

## 3. What CalmOS Is NOT
- Not a social app
- Not a fitness tracker
- Not a to-do list replacement
- Not a meditation app

## 4. Core Daily Question CalmOS Answers
“What should I do today to feel calm and perform at my best?”

## 5. Core Loop
Wellness → Focus → Flow Score → Insight → Adjustment → Better Tomorrow

## 6. Design Principles
- Calm > Features
- Fewer inputs, better outputs
- Decisions over dashboards
- Intelligence must be explainable
