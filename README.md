# CalmOS

CalmOS is a personal operating system for focus, flow, and wellbeing.

Instead of tracking more, CalmOS helps you decide better:
- When to work
- What to work on
- How to stay calm and productive

## Core Idea
CalmOS learns from your daily wellness and focus data to compute a Flow Score
and suggest small adjustments that improve performance without burnout.

## Status
🚧 In active development
